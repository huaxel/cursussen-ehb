    <em>Stephen King's best adapted movie</em>
    <p>
      I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw
      <strong>The Shawshank Redemption</strong>. Shawshank encompasses
      friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. What is so great about the
      movie is that it moves you; it gives you hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are
      quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters
      are going through.

      King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle
      Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best
      adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was
      brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick, and of course, the aforementioned
      Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes
      onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to
      understand what King wants to say, and he conveys that beautifully.
    </p>

      What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys.
      It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been
      sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He
      never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of
      tenacity, patience, and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind
      and spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has
      never been anything like it before, and I don't know if there will be
      again.
